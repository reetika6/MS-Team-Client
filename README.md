##Used Agile Methodology
I used agile methodology to complete this project and to start up with this I followed scrum methodology-subset of Agile and divided my work period into 4 sprints(each 1 
week long) In my first sprint I explored and learned the working of required frameworks, protocols and libraries to build the project and planned what to implement next
In my 2nd sprint I worked on implementing the mandatory feature that is a video connection between atleast two users and 
In the 3rd sprint I added on small features like
mute/unmute turning video on/off and resolving some debugs
In my 4th sprint I worked on implementing chat feature and I added chat during the call and then added the feature of starting the conversation before the meeting
and continue it even after the meeting. Then in the last two days I worked on CSS and deployed my product 
Thus I completed it within the time and in a smooth manner by following Agile Methodology
